# Tarkov One Stop
Welcome to the work-in-progress Tarkov One Stop.

Here my goal is to make a community driven site with tools that help the community in exactly the way they want. Currently, nothing is in a finished state. Any and all feedback is appreciated right now to help develop this into a site that works for it's users.

## What there currently is
Right now there is a functioning ammo chart. This chart allows users to quickly filter, sort, and view ammo calibers. The UI will be expanded on later down the road.

## Some future goals
These are a couple goals I'm currently tracking. More will be added when I receive more ideas and feedback from the community.
* Maps
    * These will be community driven maps. When I say community driven, I mean very similar to the way a wiki runs. I want people to be able to add loot points, and areas of interest. As well as be able to have your own map that only you can see (or share).
* Armor
    * List all armors and the data for them. Once more info is acquired for penetartion, a penetration chart will be added.
